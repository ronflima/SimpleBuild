# Sample Project File
# (C) 2017 - Ronaldo Faria Lima
#

# This was created with git submodules in mind. So, MODULES variable contains a
# list of names of modules used by your project. Your modules must be placed on
# Modules directory. If you want to place your modules someplace else, you can
# override here the DEPS variable. See main Makefile to see how it is
# created. But edit it here.
MODULES=Module1 Module2

# This is the xcodeproj bundle for your project. 
PROJECT=YourProject.xcodeproj

# This is the scheme you want to build from command line
SCHEME=YourProjectScheme

# This is the target you want to build from command line
TARGET=YourProjectTarget

#
# Overrides
#

# Uncomment below if you want to build on Debug mode. By default, the main
# makefile builds using Release configuration.

# CONFIGURATION=Debug

# Uncomment and edit below if you want to have your submodules placed on a
# directory different from Modules. Replace the Modules/% to MyPlace/% to setup
# the correct directory.

# DEPS=${MODULES:%=Modules/%}

#
# Uncomment and edit below to customize where your derived data will
# reside. CAREFUL: the clean-all target will recursively delete this directory.
#

# BUILDDIR=build

#
# Uncomment and edit below to customize Xcode's destination settings. By
# default, it uses the generic setting for iOS compilation.
#

# DESTINATION="generic/platform=iOS"
